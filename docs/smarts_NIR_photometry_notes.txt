photometry for SMARTS NIR images should be the most annoying work...

first, do sky subtraction:
sn.smarts_nir_flt_image_reduction_sky_substraction

then try to get the bkg and fwhm of the images:
the typical routine will very likely fail... 

do PSF photometry
improper bkg value (eg. 0) and fwhm (too large) will cause the PSF photometry task fail

assign one template image to the images in the filter then prepare the reference star mag list
sn.get_template_reference_mags_flt

relative calibration:
sn._photometry__get_relative_mag_single_manual_match

calibration to 2mass:
sn._photometry__get_tpl_calibrated_mag_manual_method
