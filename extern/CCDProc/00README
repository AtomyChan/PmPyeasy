                    Installing ccdproc & friends
                    Version 1.5 - 2005 January 21

See RELEASE.txt for information about this release of ccdproc and friends.

The current release of the CCDProc suite contains code for the following
executables:

	ccdproc    -- CCD processing program
	imcombine  -- simple image combination (mean or sum)
	normalize  -- divide an image by its mean (for flats)
	dicer      -- dice an image into subimages
	flt2int    -- convert floating (BITPIX=-32) images to ints (BITPIX=16)
        imstat     -- compute basic image statistics [min/max/mean/mode/sigma]

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

0) ccdproc requires that you have a recent version of the gcc compiler
   available on your system.  ccdproc and its relatives are not 100%
   guaranteed under Sun's ANSI C compilers, and will not compile under the
   non-ANSI generic (ucb) C compiler that shipped with older SunOS boxes.
   GNU's gcc is a public-domain ANSI-C compiler.  

   ** NOTE: on the OSU Astronomy Linux network, the ccdproc distribution
            comes ready to use the stock gcc compiler already on the system.


1) Unpack the tar file where you want to create the CCDProc directory.
   
        % zcat ccdproc.tgz | tar xvf -

   This creates the CCDProc/ directory tree.


2) If you have at least version 2.0 of the HEASARC cfitsio libraries
   on your machine, find out the full path to where the files
   ``libcfitsio.a'' and ``fitsio.h'' reside.  They should be in the
   same directory.  Skip ahead to step 3.

   ** NOTE: on the OSU Astronomy Linux network, the latest version of the
            cfitsio is always loaded on all machines.  The source code
            is located in /usr/local/pkg/cfitsio, and the default settings
            in the Makefile are already setup for this configuration.
            OSU USERS CAN THEREFORE SKIP THIS STEP.

   If you do not have version 2.0 or later of the HEASARC cfitsio
   subroutine libraries installed on your machine, you will need to
   get this package and build it now.  The latest version as of this
   release is 2.032 (1999 May 26), but I have only tested it with
   v2.031 (1999 March 31).  Release notes suggest that the new version
   has changes that do not suggest an urgent upgrade for this package.

   The libraries are available on the web at 

        http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/

   installation is easy, just follow the directions.  Full user
   documentation is available at the same URL.  As of the last code
   release of CCDProc, we are requiring that you upgrade to v2.0 of
   CFITSIO, as this version implements the Year2000-compliant ISO8601
   date/time format for FITS headers that will became standard in 1999.

   Once you've installed the cfitsio libraries, remember the path to
   where the source directory resides.  You will need this for the
   next steps to compile ccdproc.

3) Go to the CCDProc directory

        % cd CCDProc

   and edit the Makefile to edit the values of these environment
   variables:

	CFITSIO=/usr/local/pkg/cfitsio

   replace this definition with the path to your version of the 
   CFITSIO libraries from step 2 (OSU users: this is already correct for
   our system so leave it as is).

   Then set the CCDBin directory to point to where you want the
   executables to go.  For testing purposes, this is setup by default
   to the current working directory (.):

	CCDBin=.

   In this case, the Makefile will create executables of ccdproc and
   friends "in place", meaning in the same directory as the
   source code.  If you want to instead have a separate "installed
   binary" directory, change the value of CCDBin to point to that
   directory.  For example, to install them in /home/pollux/smith/bin,
   you would set

	CCDBin=/home/pollux/smith/bin

   And when you type "make install" they will be copied there.
   *IF* you do this, you need to go down to the "install:" section
   of the Makefile and uncomment the "\cp" lines so that the move
   takes place.  We do this to cut out the chatter when cp tries
   to copy the binaries into themselves (the shell will gripe).

   Finally, check the path to your gcc given by

	CC=gcc

   If "gcc" is in your default path, no changes are needed.  If, however,
   you need to give an explicit path, change it like so

	CC=/usr/bin/gcc


4) Edit the CCDProc.h file.  If you are on a SunOS machine, you will
   need to make sure that 

        #define __SUNOS 

   is defined.  If you are on a Solaris or Linux box, this line must read:

        #undef __SUNOS

   The instructions in the CCDProc.h file will guide you.

   *** OSU Astronomy users may skip this step, unless they are installing
       the package on a Solaris machine.


5) Compile the ccdproc and imcombine programs using make.

	% make clean

   Will erase any lingering defunct .o or binary files.  Then type

	% make

   This should compile all of the utility subroutines and the
   executables of ccdproc and imcombine.   When you are satisfied
   things are working, you will type

	% make install

   Which will do the post-compilation cleanup and if you have set
   CCDBin to point to a special bin/ directory, it will copy the
   executables there.

   This should make the ccdproc executable in the current working
   directory.

   For additional information, see the ccdproc.hlp file for a
   description of the program and examples of proc files.
