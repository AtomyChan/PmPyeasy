imcombine - sum (or average) a set of FITS images

USAGE: 
  imcombine [-anBslh] outfile infile1 infile2 ...

OPTIONS:
  outfile is the FITS image to create
  infile1 infile2 ... are the input FITS images
  -a = average instead of sum
  -n = normalize to mean of 1.0
  -Bsc:ec,sr:er = coordinates of box for -n, default is whole image
  -s = output short integer (BITPIX=16), default is FLOAT
  -l = output long integer (BITPIX=32), default is FLOAT

  -h = print "help" message (usage message) and exit

Combines together a set of images by either summation or averaging
(simple unweighted arithmetic mean).  Can also generate an image
normalized to mean=1.0 by computing the mean data value within a given
region of interest.

EXAMPLES:

       imcombine -l mb9804.fits mb9804.001 mb9804.002 mb9804.003

sum together mb9804.001 thru mb9804.003, creating the file mb9804.fits
with long-integer (BITPIX=32) format data.  Another way to do this would
have been to type:

       imcombine -l mb9804.fits mb9804.00[1-3]

or

       imcombine -l mb9804.fits mb9804.00*

if all of the mb9804.00* files in the current directory are the ones of
interest.  In general, use wildcards with caution.

A mean of a stack of images may be computed using the command:

       imcombine -a mzero.fits zero*.fits

which creates a mean zero frame, mzero.fits, from zero frames zero*.fits
in the current working directory.

To make a normalized mean flat, you would issue the following command:

       imcombine -a -n -B17:528,1:512 mvflat.fits vflat.00*.fits

which creates a mean normalized flat, mvflat.fits, from files
vflat.00*.fits, normalizing to 1.0 within the region of interest defined
by the box bounded by coordinates [17:528,1:512].

COMPILING:

imcombine uses the CCDPRoc.h header file and the same set of prototypes.
It is therefore able to be compiled using the gccfits script provided
with the PLANET CCDProc distribution:

       gccfits imcombine

This guarantees that imcombine is compiled with the HEASARC cfitsio
libraries.

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES:

imcombine uses the HEASARC cfitsio library, which is available online 
at URL:

       http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/

DISTRIBUTION:

imcombine will be distributed with version v1.2 of the ccdproc
program, although it is currently available as an add-on with
v1.1 (current version at URL:
