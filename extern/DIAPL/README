The programs are provided for those who would like to try
the optimal image subtraction algorithm of Alard & Lupton (1998, ApJ, 503, 325)
Currently there is a limited support by Wojtek Pych (pych@camk.edu.pl).
The manual is under construction.

There are separate directories for each of the C-programs with
the appropriate makefile.

*.par files are stored in PARS directory and contain typical parameter
values used for reductions.

Shell scripts (tcsh) are stored in SCRIPTS directory.
They seem to work under Red Hat LINUX. No other operating systems were
tested so far.

Typical run of the pipeline consits of the following steps:
	diapl_setup.csh
	mktpllist.csh
	shifts.csh
	template.csh
	pipe.csh
