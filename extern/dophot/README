Dear user,

DoPHOT is a computer program to obtain PSF photometry from astronomical images, 
written in the '90s by P.Schechter, M. Mateo, and A. Saha. You can get a 
complete and deep explanation of its main characteristics, and how it works 
from their published article on the program ("DoPHOT, A CCD Photometry Program:
Description and Tests", 1993 PASP, 105, 1345).

You are about to run MY distribution of Dophot. The main new characteristics 
of this distribution of DoPHOT are:
- All the program subroutines and functions have been rewritten to make them 
  compatible with the standards of Fortran90.
- I have tried to make the subroutines and functions more easily readable. 
  To achieve that, I have eliminated all the common statements present in 
  previous versions and named all the variables used by the subroutine and 
  function in the call statement. Also with the same spirit of making 
  the program more understandable I have created, combined or eliminated 
  some of the subroutines, and included, at the beginning of each file, 
  a brief explanation of what every function and subroutine does.
- The program works now with real values for the pixel values, so you do 
  not need to worry about conversions to integers as in previous distributions.
- The stars are masked, obliterated, added, and substracted across the 
  different subroutines of the program in circular sections, and not in 
  rectangular sections as before. This way less usable pixels are obliterated, 
  and less pixels outside an interesting radius are dealt with. 
- The program provides the option of just doing aperture photometry. Truly it 
  is kind of an 'enhanced' aperture photometry, since the program uses its 
  algorithms to locate stars, and only at the end calculates the photometry 
  of the found objects performing aperture photometry, but with the neighbours 
  subtracted, which should lead to more accurate aperture photometry.
- The program provides the option for more precise location and identification 
  of 'volcano' objects (saturated objects that due to the reduction process 
  show a fictitious decrease of counts towards their centers). ***
- The program provides the option to obtain the photometry of saturated 
  objects.*** 

In addition to this, this distribution share some of the characteristics of 
the program that were present in previous distributions, but that were not 
mention in the original paper.
- DoPHOT allows for a variable PSF model in the image.
- DoPHOT can perform an aperture correction to the magnitudes obtained, 
  according to their positions and magnitudes. The program checks for 
  variations in the aperture correction in magnitide and in position 
  in the image, and corrects the fitted magnitude accordingly.
- DoPHOT can try to match the positions of the stars with those of a
  given file, using the auto-matching option. This characteristic is
  additional to the warmstart described in section 4.7 of the DoPHOT
  paper. Here the program does not use the positions given to find the
  photometry of the stars there, but first find the stars and their
  photometry as if no warmstart is present, and only in the end tries
  to match the stellar positions with the ones contained in the file
  given. This is useful if, for example, we have images in several
  filters and we want to get a color-magnitude diagram, for which we
  will need to match the stars found in the different filters.

As I have rewritten most of the subroutines and written some new ones, 
any problem that you may find will probably be my fault, and not a problem 
in the original program. I have run this distribution of DoPHOT on only a 
limited basis, but to my knowledge, everything seems to work fine. However, 
if you find any bug or problem, please report it to me (jalonso@astro.puc.cl), 
so I can fix it in the updated version of the program that I keep in my webpage.

How to compile the program:

Dophot needs you to have previously installed in your computer 
a Fortran90 compiler (I use GNU gfortran), and the libcfitsio.a library.
To get the cfitsio library,download in your computer the last version of cfitsio
(Unix.tar file in http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/?ref=darwinports.com), 
uncompress and compile cfitsio (if using a Mac, check 
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/mac_universal_binary.html)
Once you have gfortran (or similar compiler), and libcfitsio.a, edit the 
Makefile file of this distribution of DoPHOT and change it accordingly to 
where your library is and the compiler you use, save it and type

 > make dophot

and you should be able to run the program by typing in the command line

> dophot

DoPHOT parameters:

DoPHOT needs a good (but not perfect) set of initial parameters to run 
appropiately. The set of parameters used and a brief explanation of their 
function can be found by checking the paramdefault file included in the 
distribution. The parameters neccesary to correctly run the program 
can be supply to program by editing the paramdefault file, or better, 
creating a tuneup file with the values of the parameters we want, 
and running DoPHOT by writting in the command line

 > dophot file.tuneup

The parameters that most definetely you will need to provide are:
FWHM = first guess of the FWHM, 10% precision is good enough.
SKY = first guess for the sky value, 10% precision is good enough.
EPERDN =  electrons per data number, 'gain', usually available in imageÂ´s header
RDNOISE = readout noise in electrons, usually available in header of the image.
TOP = maximum allowed data value in data numbers, the saturation limit.
IMAGE_IN = ' '  Input image name. 
OBJECTS_OUT = ' '   Output object list file name.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output format:

The results after running the program can be presented in 5 different ways 
according to the value of the OBJTYPE_OUT parameter.

OBJTYPE_OUT = 'INTERNAL'
  Format: Stellar function parameters (1-7), aperture parameters(1-4), 
           extendedness 
          (see subroutines stpar and improve for a proper explanation) 

OBJTYPE_OUT = 'COMPLETE'
  Format: Star number, objtype, xpos, ypos, fitmag, err_fitmag, fitsky, 
          FWHM_major, FWHM_minor, tilt, extendedness, apmag, err_apmag, 
          apsky, diff_fit_ap(apcorr)

OBJTYPE_OUT = 'INCOMPLETE'
  Format: Star number,xpos,ypos,fitmag,err_fitmag,fitsky,objtype,extendedness,
          diff_fit_ap(apcorr)

OBJTYPE_OUT = 'BINARY'
  Format: objtype,xpos,ypos,fitmag,err_fitmag,fitsky,FWHM_major,FWHM_minor,tilt

OBJTYPE_OUT = 'DAOPHOT' (this is the default option)
  Format: Star number,xpos,ypos,fitmag,err_fitmag,fitsky,objtype,chi,
          diff_fit_ap(apcorr)

The objtype refers to the type of the object observed. DoPHOT classifies all 
the observed found objects in 9 different types:
 Type 1: A "perfect" star. Type 1 objects are used to compute the 7-parameter
         weighted-mean stellar shape used to extract photometric data 
         from an image.
 Type 2: The object is not as peaked as a star and has been classified as 
         a "galaxy".
 Type 3: A blend of 2 close stars, with the data being for one component of 
         the pair. The final fit uses mean shape parameters for single stars 
         determined from all type 1 objects on the image.
 Type 4: Fit failed to converge on a 4-parameter fit based on the mean 
         single-star shape. Photometry is unreliable.
 Type 5: Not enough points with adequate S/N for a full 7-parameter fit, 
         so a 4-parameter fit attempted and succeeded. Photometry is suspect, 
         and may indicate image problems or that the object is not a star.
 Type 6: Too few points with adequate S/N for even a 4-parameter fit with 
         the mean Type 1 star shape. Not subtracted from the image.
 Type 7: Object too faint for a full 7-parameter mean-star fit. No object 
         classification is possible. The results are for a 4-parameter fit, 
         and are reasonable only if the object really is a star.
 Type 8: Object was "obliterated" becase it was determined to be saturated, 
         either above the pre-set threshold or found to be flat-topped.
 Type 9: Fit failed to converge or center of the star out of the image.
         Photometry is unreliable.
In addition to these types, stars from a warmstart with positions and/or
shapes fixed are given types equal to the ones described plus 10.

Note that with the DAOPHOT option stars of type 4, 6, 8, and 9 will not 
appear in the summary file.

Masking bad regions:

Sometimes we find in the images 'hot' pixels and columns, or bad regions 
that we want to mask. To tell DoPHOT about their existance, and make it mask 
them, we can use a little trick: we can tell DoPHOT that these regions are 
saturating stars (type 8 objects), we just need to find the center of the 
region (starpar3 and starpar4 parameter) and its width and height (actually, 
half-width and half-height, to be given as starpar5 and starpar7 parameters). 
Hence if we create a file with the parameters of these objects and feed DoPHOT 
with it as it was a warmstart (just provide the file name as the OBJECTS_IN 
parameter in the tuneup or paramdefault file), DoPHOT will obliterate these 
regions.
NOTE: Notice that since these regions have usually a rectangular shape, I have 
modified the warmstart subroutine to obliterate these "type 8 stars" in 
rectangles, not in circles like in the rest of the program.

*** USE CAUTION Options to locate the 'volcano' stars and to provide
the photometry for saturated objects should be use with extra caution
since they are only in alpha testing. Especially the photometry of
saturated stars can show significant deviations (more than 0.1 mag of
the true value) at 1-1.5 magnitudes over the saturation limit.
