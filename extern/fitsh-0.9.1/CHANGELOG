0.9.1: new features, changes and fixes since FITSH version 0.9.0
================================================================
 * fix: lfit/linear.so: -dylib argument is fixed on Mac/OSX targets. 
 * new: fiphot: from now, a formally zero gain (--gain 0) imply an "infinite" 
	gain, i.e. no photon noise from the detector. It can be conveniently 
	used for photometry on images of instruments where photon noise is not 
	an issue (e.g. Hersche/PACS images) or when photon noise is completely
	negligible (e.g. photometry of very faint targets).
 * new: fiarith: new per-image functions sign(.) and theta(.) are added.
	sign(.) is the standard sign function while theta(.) is 
	the Heaviside step function (that is zero for negative numbers
	and unity for non-negative numbers).
 * fix: fiphot: some minor bug fixes related to the polynomial gain 
	variation handling.
 * new: fitrans: simple image shift operations can be implied now
	using the -e or --shift command line options. 
 * fix: lfit: the LIBC/math calls of finite(.) have been replaced to 
	isfinite(.).
 * chg: The `fizip` and `fiunzip` tasks are removed from the whole package.
	We suggest to use the more sophisticated, faster and standard
	FITS compression tools `fpack` and `funpack`, that works nicely
	in parallel with the task of the FITSH package (not transparently, but
	standard input/output pipes can be built easily). As of now, a native 
	support for the tile compression method used by `fpack`	and `funpack` 
	is not planned. 
 * chg: Some standard project files (./AUTHORS, ./CHANGELOG, ./COPYING, 
	./INSTALL and ./README) have been added to the source tree. 
 * new: The target `make deb` creates a Debian package on the current 
	architecture (this feature requies the `dpkg-deb` utility and also
	depends on the `help2man` program in order to create the manual pages
	that also should go into the Debian package). 
 * new: Related to the new `make deb` target, the subdirectory ./deb (currently
	with two files) has been created in the source tree. 

0.9.0
=====
 * new:	The first public release of the FITSH package. See ./README and the 
	inline reference manuals (--long-help) for further details. 
	See also ./INSTALL for installation tips.
