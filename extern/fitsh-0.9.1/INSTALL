FITSH - Installation 
*********************

Standard local installation:
----------------------------

The `FITSH` package can be installed using the standard 

`./configure && make && make install`

procedure. A more detailed description about the package and the 
installation is available on the web page of projects, found at 
http://fitsh.szofi.net/.

Install as a Debian package:
----------------------------

Alternatively, you can install this program as a Debian package. 
After `./configure && make`, use the target `make deb` to create the 
*.deb file. This feature requires the `help2man` utility as well as 
the `dpkg-deb` program to be installed on your system. If the *.deb
file (named something like "fitsh_0.9.1_amd64.deb") is created successfully,
use the `dpkg` command to install it:

`dpkg --install fitsh_0.9.1_amd64.deb`

Then, you can use any of your favourite *.deb package manager (dpkg, apt,
dselect, synaptic, ...) to manage this package. After installing `FITSH` as 
a Debian package, the manual pages also automatically become available for 
the `man` command, in section (1).
