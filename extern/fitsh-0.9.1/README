FITSH - a software package for astronomical image processing - version 0.9.1
****************************************************************************

This software package provides a set of independent binary programs 
(tasks) that are designed for execution from a UNIX command line shell 
or shell script. Each of these tasks performs a specific operation (e.g. 
transforming an image to another reference frame, search and identifiy 
stars or other point-like sources, do photometry, transform/display a 
FITS image to a popular graphics format, ...) while the details of a 
certain operation are specified via command switches and arguments. 
Therefore this package does not need any higher level operating 
environment than a standard UNIX shell, however, processing the related 
data might require a little more knowledge of the used shell itself (the 
related documentation and examples found in this page use the bash 
shell). Additionally, some of the processing steps might require minor 
or basic operations performed with other tools like awk or text 
processing utilities (sort, uniq, paste, ...).

For a brief summary about the individual tasks, check the ``Tasks'' 
section of the web page of the project, namely at

Supported systems and requirements
----------------------------------

Actually, the program has been developed under GNU/Linux (Debian, i386 
and amd64), and it also tested and seems to work properly on Sun/SunOS, 
PC/NetBSD and Mac/OSX systems as well. The Mac/OSX port has been tested 
under the version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) with its default GCC 
(gcc-4.2.1).

However, please note that the primary development platform of the 
package is Debian GNU/Linux, thus compilation-time warnings might occur 
on other operating systems.

Documentation
-------------

The FITSH tasks have a built-in self-explaining reference documentation 
system, that can be asked using the --long-help option. The format of 
this long-help output is a standard to the `help2man` utility, with 
which nice manual pages can be generated easily (and then these can be 
converted to PDF or PostScript as well). See also the `make help2man` 
Makefile-target: this target builds the manual pages as well as converts 
them into PostScript format if the utilities `help2man` and `groff` 
are installed properly on the host operating system. 

The web page of the project (http://fitsh.szofi.net) also displays these 
manual pages as well as one can find further, completely working 
examples.

of the code have been developed for the Hungarian-made Automated 
Telescope (HAT) project to make the data processing easier
and more convenient. Further (and current) development is supported
by the ESA PECS grant no. PECS 98073.
