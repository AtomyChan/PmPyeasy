Description: FITSH - a software package for astronomical image processing
 This software package provides a set of independent binary programs 
 (tasks) that are designed for execution from a UNIX command line shell or 
 shell script. Each of these tasks performs a specific operation (e.g. 
 transforming an image to another reference frame, search and identifiy 
 stars or other point-like sources, do photometry, transform/display a 
 FITS image to a popular graphics format, ...) while the details of a 
 certain operation are specified via command switches and arguments. 
 Therefore this package does not need any higher level operating environment 
 than a standard UNIX shell, however, processing the related data might 
 require a little more knowledge of the used shell itself. If you find this 
 program useful in your research, please cite the preprint arXiv:1111.1998,
 as "2011, accepted in MNRAS". See also the web page of the project, found at 
 http://fitsh.szofi.net/. That page gathers information about the program 
 (including documentation and examples), this is the primary download source 
 of the package itself, and additionally, serves a public forum for the 
 program users in various topics. Bug reports, comments and ideas are welcomed!
