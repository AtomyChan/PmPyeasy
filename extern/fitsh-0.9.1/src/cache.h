/* cache_init():
   Initializes the cache 'ch' on the opened file descriptor 'fh'. 
   The number of 'recordcount' objects (each with the size of 'recordsize')
   are assumed to be stored in the file. If we want to write into the 
   file (using caching), set 'is_write' to a non-zero value (or
   CACHE_READ_AND_WRITE), otherwise set it to zero (or CACHE_READONLY).
   The caching will be done in 'nchblock' cache blocks, each block will have
   the size of 'multip' times the least common multiple of recordsize
   and the architecture's preferred pagesize (reported by the getpagesize()
   system call). The total count of cache blocks which will be used can be
   figured out using cache_tcblock(). If 'nchblock' is less than or equal to
   this value, all data can be cached into memory. Note that 'nchblock' cannot
   exceed 32k-1 (32767). If all data wants to be cached, increase 'multip'
   to have a tcblock count less than 32k.
     Note also that the maximum number of 'recordcount' is also architecture
   and/or compile-time dependent. If "off_t" is a 32-bit integer (sizeof(off_t) 
   is 4), then the maximum number of objects is 2G, if "off_t" is a 64-bit 
   integer (sizeof(off_t) is 8), then the maximum number of objects is 8E. The 
   implementation of "off_t" depends on the architecture and can be tuned
   during compilation time using -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS={32|64}. Be careful,
   because of even on modern unixes and 64-bit architectures(!), the default
   "off_t" type can either be a 32-bit integer. This library not uses the 
   type of "long long", therefore it is fully ANSI-compatible and pedantic.  */
